# talkinghead
Talkinghead satirizes the unmoderated and self-serving nature of modern "instant media" by simulting a debate between two political pundits that places the user in the seat of the host. The two simulated AI pundits are animated chatbots that debate the questions posed by the user and draw from real political comments made by reddit users between 2008 and 2018.

Through this work, I aim to mock and exaggerate the feedback loop between the media that is delivered to users and that which is mined from users. It is intended to make the user think about how their own participation in social media is both directed by and participates in driving the current collective consciousness.

Talkinghead takes political punditry to its only logical conclusion: replacing human-powerd analysis with computer-generated models which, ironically, are datamined from the thoughts of real human beings. The artificial pundit convices the human of its opinion, which inspires the user to share that opinion on social media, only to be datamined and once again inform the artificial intelligence.
